# Running instructions

The easiest way to get the project running, is to open the sln file in the top directory, build the solution and run the VCC.ProductPricingApiTest.Api and VCC.ProductPricingApiTest.Web files from within the solution. This should launch both the api and web solutions in your default browser. The API will default to a swagger view so you can play just with the API endpoints, and the web view will default to the home page from which you can access the Products page from the left hand nav bar

# Other notes

There is a Notes.txt file in the top directory with some of my design thoughts, considerations and ideas for future improvements.
